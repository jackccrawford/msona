# Security Documentation

## API Key Management

### Environment Variables
All sensitive API keys are stored as environment variables:
- `GROK_API_KEY`: For X.AI/Grok transformations
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`: For text-to-speech synthesis
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`: For music discovery

### Serverless Functions
API calls are routed through Netlify Functions to protect keys:
- `/api/transform`: Handles Grok API requests
- `/api/speech`: Handles ElevenLabs synthesis
- Keys never exposed in client-side code

### Local Development
1. Create `.env` file from `.env.example`
2. Add your API keys
3. Never commit `.env` to version control
4. Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files

### Production Deployment
1. Configure environment variables in Netlify dashboard
2. Keys stored securely in Netlify's environment
3. Automatic HTTPS encryption
4. Rate limiting and error handling included

## Best Practices

### API Requests
- All requests proxy through serverless functions
- Rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Error handling and recovery
- Request validation and sanitization

### Client-Side Security
- No sensitive data in browser
- CORS protection
- Content Security Policy headers
- XSS prevention measures

### Code Security
- Dependencies regularly updated
- Security vulnerabilities monitored
- Code review process
- Secure coding guidelines

## Monitoring

### Error Tracking
- Comprehensive error logging
- Security event monitoring
- Rate limit tracking
- API usage analytics

### Health Checks
- API endpoint monitoring
- Service availability checks
- Performance metrics
- Error rate monitoring
